<p>You may <b>not</b> want to use Arch, if:
</p>
<ul>
<li>you do not have the ability/time/desire for a 'do-it-yourself' GNU/Linux distribution.</li>
<li>you require support for an architecture other than x86_64.</li>
<li>you take a strong stand on using a distribution which only provides free software as defined by GNU.</li>
<li>you believe an operating system should configure itself, run out of the box, and include a complete default set of software and desktop environment on the installation media.</li>
<li>you do not want a rolling release GNU/Linux distribution.</li>
<li>you are happy with your current OS.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<span id="What_architectures_does_Arch_support.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="What_architectures_does_Arch_support?">What architectures does Arch support?</span>
</h3>
<p>Arch only supports the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x86_64" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:x86 64">x86_64</a> (sometimes called amd64) architecture. Support for i686 was dropped in November 2017 <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archlinux.org/news/the-end-of-i686-support/">[1]</a>. 
</p>
<p>There are <i>unofficial</i> ports for the i686 architecture <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archlinux32.org/">[2]</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ARM architecture">ARM</a> CPUs <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archlinuxarm.org/">[3]</a>, each with their own community channels. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://ix.io/73w/irc">[4]</a>

<p>Arch Linux follows the <i>file system hierarchy</i> for operating systems using the <a href="/title/Systemd" title="Systemd">systemd</a> service manager. See <span class="plainlinks archwiki-template-man" title="$ man 7 file-hierarchy"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/file-hierarchy.7">file-hierarchy(7)</a></span> for an explanation of each directory along with their designations. In particular, <code>/bin</code>, <code>/sbin</code>, and <code>/usr/sbin</code> are symbolic links to <code>/usr/bin</code>, and <code>/lib</code> and <code>/lib64</code> are symbolic links to <code>/usr/lib</code>.

</h3>
<p>If you are a beginner and want to use Arch, you must be willing to invest time into learning a new system, and accept that Arch is designed as a 'do-it-yourself' distribution; it is the user who assembles the system.
</p>
<p>Before asking for help, do your own independent research by searching the Web, the forum and the superb documentation provided by the Arch Wiki. <i>There is a reason these resources were made available to you in the first place.</i> Many thousands of <i>volunteered</i> hours have been spent compiling this excellent information.

</h3>
<p>Arch is not designed for any particular type of use. Rather, it is designed for a particular type of <i>user</i>. Arch targets competent users who enjoy its 'do-it-yourself' nature, and who further exploit it to shape the system to fit their unique needs. Therefore, in the hands of its target user base, Arch can be used for virtually any purpose. Many use Arch on both their desktops and workstations. And of course, archlinux.org, aur.archlinux.org and almost all of Arch's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/infrastructure">infrastructure</a> runs on Arch.

</h3>
<p>Arch Linux releases are simply a live environment for installation or rescue, which include the <span class="plainlinks archwiki-template-pkg"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=base">base</a></span> <a href="/title/Meta_package" class="mw-redirect" title="Meta package">meta package</a> and a few <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/archiso/-/blob/master/configs/releng/packages.x86_64">other packages</a>. The releases are issued usually in the first half of every month.

</h3>
<p>It is <i>the user</i> who is ultimately responsible for the stability of their own rolling release system. The user decides when to upgrade, and merges necessary changes when required. If the user reaches out to the community for help, it is often provided in a timely manner. The difference between Arch and other distributions in this regard is that Arch is truly a 'do-it-yourself' distribution; complaints of breakage are misguided and unproductive, since upstream changes are not the responsibility of Arch devs.
</p>
<p>See the <a href="/title/System_maintenance" title="System maintenance">System maintenance</a> article for tips on how to make an Arch Linux system as stable as possible.

<p>Arch gets plenty of press as it is. The goal of Arch Linux is not to be large; rather, organic, sustainable growth occurs naturally amongst the target user base.

<p>Also note that Arch Linux does not come with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_shaping" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Traffic shaping">traffic shaping</a> enabled. Thus, it is possible that if a program on it somehow utilizes your internet connection to the full – regardless if it is over P2P or classic client-server connections – other local ones will find it clogged, resulting in severe lags and timeouts. Relief can be provided by <a href="/title/Firewalls" class="mw-redirect" title="Firewalls">firewalls</a> such as <i>Shorewall</i> or <i>Vuurmuur</i>; there are also static scripts for <span class="plainlinks archwiki-template-pkg"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=iproute2">iproute2</a></span> (such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://serendipity.ruwenzori.net/index.php/2008/06/01/modified-wondershaper-for-better-voip-qos">this derivative</a> of <i>Wondershaper</i>), which allow shaping on the network layer.

<h3>
<span id="Why_is_Arch_using_all_my_RAM.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Why_is_Arch_using_all_my_RAM?">Why is Arch using all my RAM?</span>
</h3>
<p>Essentially, unused RAM is wasted RAM.
</p>
<p>Many new users notice how the Linux kernel handles memory differently than they are used to. Since accessing data from RAM is much faster than from a storage drive, the kernel caches recently accessed data in memory. The cached data is only cleared when the system begins to run out of available memory and new data needs to be loaded.
</p>
<p>We could distinguish the difference from <code>free</code> command:
</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0; border-bottom:none; padding-bottom:0.8em;">$ free -h</pre>
<pre style="margin-top: 0; border-top-style:dashed; padding-top: 0.8em;">              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:          2.8Gi       1.1Gi       283Mi       224Mi       1.4Gi       1.2Gi
Swap:         3.0Gi       881Mi       2.1Gi
</pre>
<p>It is important to note the difference between "free" and "available" memory. In the above example, a laptop with 2.8 GiB of total RAM appears to be using most of it, with only 283 MiB as free memory.  However, 1.4 GiB of it is "buff/cache". There is still 1.2 GiB available for starting new applications, without swapping. See <span class="plainlinks archwiki-template-man" title="$ man 1 free"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/free.1">free(1)</a></span> for details.

<p>First, you need to figure out if this error is something the Arch team can fix. Sometimes it is not (e.g. Firefox crashes may be the fault of the Mozilla team); this is called an <i>upstream error</i>. If it is an Arch problem, there is a series of steps you can take:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Search the forums for information. See if anyone else has noticed it.</li>
<li>Post a <a href="/title/Bug_report" class="mw-redirect" title="Bug report">bug report</a> with detailed information at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bugs.archlinux.org">https://bugs.archlinux.org</a>.</li>
<li>If you would like, write a forum post detailing the problem and the fact that you have reported it already. This will help prevent a lot of people from reporting the same error.</li>
</ol>

<p>This has been discussed on the Arch mailing list. Some proposed a <i>.pac</i> file extension, but there is no plan to change the package extension. As Tobias Kieslich, one of the Arch developers, put it, "A package <b>is</b> a gzipped<i> [xz] </i>tarball! And it can be opened, investigated and manipulated by any tar-capable application. Moreover, the mime-type is automatically detected correctly by most applications."

<p>However, the best way to get a feature added to pacman or Arch Linux is to implement it yourself. The patch or code may or may not be officially accepted, but perhaps others will appreciate, test and contribute to your effort.

</h3>
<p>Several distributions, such as Debian, have different versions of shared libraries packaged as different packages: <code>libfoo1</code>, <code>libfoo2</code>, <code>libfoo3</code> and so on. In this way it is possible to have applications compiled against different versions of <code>libfoo</code> installed on the same system.
</p>
<p>In case of a distribution like Arch, only the latest stable versions of packages are officially supported. By dropping support for outdated software, package maintainers are able to spend more time ensuring that the newest versions work as expected. As soon as a new version of a shared library becomes available from upstream, it is added to the repositories and affected packages are rebuilt to use the new version.

</h3>
<p>This scenario should not happen at all. Assuming an application called <code>foobaz</code> is in one of the official repositories and builds successfully against a new version of a shared library called <code>libbaz</code>, it will be updated along with <code>libbaz</code>. If, however, it does not build successfully, <code>foobaz</code> package will have a versioned dependency (e.g. <i>libbaz 1.5</i>), and will be removed by pacman during <code>libbaz</code> upgrade, due to a conflict.
</p>
<p>If <code>foobaz</code> is a package that you built yourself and installed from AUR, you should try rebuilding <code>foobaz</code> against the new version of <code>libbaz</code>. If the build fails, report the bug to the <code>foobaz</code> developers.

</h3>
<p>No, it is not possible. Major kernel updates (e.g. <i>linux 3.5.0-1</i> to <i>linux 3.6.0-1</i>) are always accompanied by rebuilds of all supported kernel driver packages. On the other hand, if you have an unsupported driver package (e.g. from the <a href="/title/AUR" class="mw-redirect" title="AUR">AUR</a>) installed on your system, then a kernel update might break things for you if you do not rebuild it for the new kernel. Users are responsible for updating any unsupported driver packages that they have installed.

</h3>
<p>Package updates will be released when they are ready. The specific amount of time can be as short as a few hours after upstream releases a minor bugfix update to as long as several weeks after a large package group's major update. The amount of time from an upstream's new version to Arch releasing a new package depends on the specific packages and the availability of the package maintainers. Additionally, some packages spend some time in the <a href="/title/Testing" class="mw-redirect" title="Testing">testing</a> repository, so this can prolong the time before a package is updated. <a href="/title/Package_maintainer" class="mw-redirect" title="Package maintainer">Package maintainers</a> attempt to work quickly to bring stable updates to the repositories.

</h3>
<p>If you are lucky, it might work, for a time. Regardless, it is not a proper solution, because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Libraries do not change versions randomly – the API/ABI will have likely changed (possibly with bits removed), and whether those changes affect the usage is just a matter of luck.</li>
<li>The symlink would be untracked by a package manager. Newbies who immediately try to hack on system library files are in the greatest risk of making an unwanted change that they cannot diagnose/fix, which a package manager helps to guard against.</li>
<li>A slight alternative of dumping the old library file into the filesystem, untracked, would be forgotten about, and not have potential security bugs noticed/patched.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, e.g. use/write a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=n&amp;K=compat">compat package</a>, which provides the required library version.

<p>If your processor is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:X86-64">x86_64</a> compatible, you will have the <code>lm</code> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_mode" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Long mode">long mode</a>) flag in <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>. For example,
</p>
<pre>$ grep -w lm /proc/cpuinfo
</pre>
<p>Under Windows, using the freeware <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php">CPU-Z</a> helps determine whether your CPU is 64-bit compatible.
CPUs with AMD's instruction set "AMD64" or Intel's solution "EM64T" should be compatible with the x86_64 releases and binary packages.

<p>It is faster under most circumstances and as an added bonus also inherently more secure due to the nature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Address space layout randomization">Address space layout randomization (ASLR)</a> in combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Position-independent code">Position-independent code (PIC)</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_Bit" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:NX Bit">NX Bit</a> which is not available in the stock i686 kernel due to disabled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Physical Address Extension">Physical Address Extension (PAE)</a>. If your computer has more than 4 GiB of RAM, only a 64-bit OS will be able to fully utilize it.
</p>
<p>Programmers also increasingly tend to care less about 32-bit ("legacy") as "new" x86 CPUs typically support the 64-bit extensions.
</p>
<p>There are many more reasons we could list here to tell you to avoid 32-bit, but between the kernel, userspace and individual programs it is simply not viable to list every last thing that 64-bit does much better these days.
