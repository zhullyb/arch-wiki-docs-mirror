<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Principles">Principles</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Simplicity">Simplicity</span></h3>
<p>Arch Linux defines simplicity as <i>without unnecessary additions or modifications</i>. It ships software as released by the original developers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_(software_development)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Upstream (software development)">upstream</a>) with minimal distribution-specific (downstream) changes: patches not accepted by upstream are avoided, and Arch's downstream patches consist almost entirely of backported bug fixes that are obsoleted by the project's next release.
</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, Arch ships the configuration files provided by upstream with changes limited to distribution-specific issues like adjusting the system file paths. It does not add automation features such as enabling a service simply because the package was installed. Packages are only split when compelling advantages exist, such as to save disk space in particularly bad cases of waste. GUI configuration utilities are not officially provided, encouraging users to perform most system configuration from the shell and a text editor.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Modernity">Modernity</span></h3>
<p>Arch Linux strives to maintain the latest stable release versions of its software as long as systemic package breakage can be reasonably avoided. It is based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rolling release">rolling-release</a> system, which allows a one-time installation with continuous upgrades.
</p>
<p>Arch incorporates many of the newer features available to GNU/Linux users, including the <a href="../en/Systemd.html" title="Systemd">systemd</a> init system, modern <a href="../en/File_systems.html" title="File systems">file systems</a>, LVM2, software RAID, udev support and initcpio (with <a href="../en/Mkinitcpio.html" title="Mkinitcpio">mkinitcpio</a>), as well as the latest available kernels.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pragmatism">Pragmatism</span></h3>
<p>Arch is a pragmatic distribution rather than an ideological one. The principles here are only useful guidelines. Ultimately, design decisions are made on a case-by-case basis through developer consensus. Evidence-based technical analysis and debate are what matter, not politics or popular opinion.
</p>
<p>The large number of packages and build scripts in the various Arch Linux repositories offer free and open source software for those who prefer it, as well as proprietary software packages for those who embrace functionality over ideology.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="User_centrality">User centrality</span></h3>
<p>Whereas many GNU/Linux distributions attempt to be more <i>user-friendly</i>, Arch Linux has always been, and shall always remain <i>user-centric</i>. The distribution is intended to fill the needs of those contributing to it, rather than trying to appeal to as many users as possible. It is targeted at the proficient GNU/Linux user, or anyone with a do-it-yourself attitude who is willing to read the documentation, and solve their own problems.
</p>
<p>All users are encouraged to <a href="../en/Getting_involved.html" title="Getting involved">participate</a> and contribute to the distribution. Reporting and helping fix <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/">bugs</a> is highly valued and patches improving packages or the core <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://projects.archlinux.org/">projects</a> are very appreciated: Arch's developers are volunteers and active contributors will often find themselves becoming part of that team. <i>Archers</i> can freely contribute packages to the <a href="../en/Arch_User_Repository.html" title="Arch User Repository">Arch User Repository</a>, improve the <a href="../en/Main_page.html" title="Main page">ArchWiki documentation</a>, provide technical assistance to others or just exchange opinions in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/">forums</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://mailman.archlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/">mailing lists</a>, or <a href="../en/Arch_IRC_channels.html" class="mw-redirect" title="IRC channels">IRC channels</a>. Arch Linux is the operating system of choice for many people around the globe, and there exist several <a href="../en/International_communities.html" title="International communities">international communities</a> that offer help and provide documentation in many different languages.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Versatility">Versatility</span></h3>
<p>Arch Linux is a general-purpose distribution. Upon installation, only a command-line environment is provided: rather than tearing out unneeded and unwanted packages, the user is offered the ability to build a custom system by choosing among thousands of high-quality packages provided in the <a href="../en/Official_repositories.html" title="Official repositories">official repositories</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x86-64" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:x86-64">x86-64</a> architecture.
</p>
<p>Arch is backed by <a href="../en/Pacman.html" title="Pacman">pacman</a>, a lightweight, simple and fast package manager that allows to upgrade the entire system with one command. Arch also provides the <a href="../en/Arch_Build_System.html" title="Arch Build System">Arch Build System</a>, a ports-like system to make it easy to build and install packages from source, which can also be synchronized with one command. In addition, the <i>Arch User Repository</i> contains many thousands more of community-contributed <a href="../en/PKGBUILD.html" title="PKGBUILD">PKGBUILD</a> scripts for compiling installable packages from source using the <a href="../en/Makepkg.html" title="Makepkg">makepkg</a> application. It is also possible for users to build and maintain their own custom repositories with ease.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The Arch community has grown and matured to become one of the most popular and influential Linux distributions, also testified by the <a href="../en/Arch_Linux_press_coverage.html" title="Arch Linux press coverage">attention and review</a> received over the years.
</p>
<p>Arch developers remain unpaid, part-time volunteers, and there are no prospects for monetizing Arch Linux, so it will remain free in all senses of the word. Those curious to peruse more detail about Arch's development history can browse the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/archlinux.org">Arch entry in the Internet Archive Wayback Machine</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archlinux.org/news/">Arch Linux News Archives</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_early_years">The early years</span></h3>
<p>Judd Vinet, a Canadian programmer and occasional guitarist, began developing Arch Linux in early 2001. Its first formal release, Arch Linux 0.1, was on March 11, 2002. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=interview-arch">Inspired</a> by the elegant simplicity of Slackware, BSD, PLD Linux and CRUX, and yet disappointed with their lack of package management at the time, Vinet built his own distribution on similar principles as those distros. But, he also wrote a package management program called <a href="../en/Pacman.html" title="Pacman">pacman</a>, to automatically handle package installation, removal, and upgrades.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_middle_years">The middle years</span></h3>
<p>The early Arch community grew steadily, as evidenced by <a href="../File:Archstats2002-2011.png" title="File:Archstats2002-2011.png">this chart of forum posts, users, and bug reports</a>. Moreover, it was from its early days known as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.osnews.com/story/4827">an open, friendly, and helpful community</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Birth_of_the_ArchWiki">Birth of the ArchWiki</span></h3>
<p>On 2005-07-08 the ArchWiki was first <a href="../en/ArchWiki:About.html#Early_history" title="ArchWiki:About">set up</a> on the MediaWiki engine.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_dawning_of_the_age_of_A._Griffin">The dawning of the age of A. Griffin</span></h3>
<p>In late 2007, Judd Vinet retired from active participation as an Arch developer, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=38024">smoothly transferred</a> the reins over to American programmer Aaron Griffin, also known as Phrakture.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Arch_Install_Scripts">Arch Install Scripts</span></h3>
<p>The 2012-07-15 release of the installation image <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archlinux.org/news/install-media-20120715-released/">deprecated</a> the menu-driven <i>Arch Installation Framework</i> (AIF) in favor of the <i>Arch Install Scripts</i> (<span class="plainlinks archwiki-template-pkg"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=arch-install-scripts">arch-install-scripts</a></span>).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_systemd_era">The systemd era</span></h3>
<p>Between 2012 and 2013 the traditional System V init system was replaced by systemd.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archlinux.org/news/install-medium-20121006-introduces-systemd/">[1]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archlinux.org/news/systemd-is-now-the-default-on-new-installations/">[2]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archlinux.org/news/end-of-initscripts-support/">[3]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://archlinux.org/news/final-sysvinit-deprecation-warning/">[4]</a>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Drop_of_i686_support">Drop of i686 support</span></h3>
<p>On 2017-01-25 it was <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archlinux.org/news/phasing-out-i686-support/">announced</a> that support for the i686 architecture would be phased out due to its decreasing popularity among the developers and the community. By the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archlinux.org/news/the-end-of-i686-support/">end of November 2017</a>, all i686 packages were removed from the mirrors.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Review_of_Project_Leader_role_and_election">Review of Project Leader role and election</span></h3>
<p>At the start of 2020, in a team effort the Arch Linux staff devised a new process for determining future leaders, documented in <a href="../DeveloperWiki:Project_Leader.html" title="DeveloperWiki:Project Leader">DeveloperWiki:Project Leader</a>.
</p>
<p>As Aaron Griffin had decided to step down from his role, a poll was held to elect a new person to replace him, and on 2020-02-24 its results were <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archlinux.org/news/the-future-of-the-arch-linux-project-leader/">published</a>, making the election of Levente Polyak official.
