<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Privacy_Policy_for_Arch_Linux">Privacy Policy for Arch Linux</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Scope_of_this_notice">Scope of this notice</span></h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to describe Arch Linux's privacy practices and provide information about the choices you have regarding the ways in which information collected by Arch Linux is used and disclosed. For convenience, Arch Linux is referred to in this document as "Arch".
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Our_commitment_to_privacy">Our commitment to privacy</span></h3>
<p>Arch values your privacy. To better protect your privacy, we have provided this Policy explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected, used and disclosed.

<li>you submit packages to the AUR.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arch may also collect personal data from individuals (with their consent) who participate and/or contribute to Arch.
The types of personal data collected may include (but are not limited to):
</p>
<ul>
<li>your first and last name;</li>
<li>your username</li>

<li>your disclosed affiliation(s).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Publicly_available_personal_data">Publicly available personal data</span></h3>
<p>Some personal data attached to Arch accounts is made public by default <i>if you opt to include it in your profile</i>. Specifically:
</p>
<ul>
<li>your GPG key ID (if defined);</li>
<li>your location (if defined)</li>
<li>your website, blog, or other affiliations (if defined).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish for this information to be kept private, you can opt-out of displaying this information publicly in your account profile. If you choose to opt-out, Arch will still have access to this information, but it will not be displayed to others, and will be considered Private.
</p>
<h3>
<span id="Using_.28processing.29_your_personal_data"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Using_(processing)_your_personal_data">Using (processing) your personal data</span>

<ul>
<li>create and maintain your accounts;</li>

<li>attribute data and content you produce directly and indirectly in our public-facing services;</li>
<li>answer your questions;</li>
<li>send you information;</li>
<li>for research activities, including the production of statistical reports, for example <a href="../en/Pkgstats.html" title="Pkgstats">pkgstats</a>, (such aggregated information is not used to contact the subjects of the report).</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sharing_your_personal_data">Sharing your personal data</span></h3>
<p>Unless you consent, Arch will never process or share the personal data you provide to us except as described below.
</p>
<p>Arch may share your personal data with third parties under any of the following circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your publicly available personal data in the Arch account system, as described above, is accessible by anyone unless you, as the account holder, opt out as already described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>As required by law (such as responding to a valid subpoena, warrant, audit, or agency action, or to prevent fraud).</li>
<li>For research activities, including the production of statistical reports (such aggregated information is used to describe our services and is not used to contact the subjects of the report).</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Receiving_e-mail">Receiving e-mail</span></h3>
<p>Arch may send you e-mail about your account, to communicate with you about your accounts, or in response to your questions. For your protection, Arch may contact you in the event that we find an issue that requires your immediate attention. Arch processes your personal data in these cases to fulfill and comply with its contractual obligations to you, to provide the services you have requested, and to ensure the security of your account.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cookies_and_other_browser_information">Cookies and other browser information</span></h3>
<p>Arch's online services automatically capture IP addresses. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with our services. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your location, in order to provide you data and content from our services as quickly as possible. It is in the interests of the Arch community to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of its services for all users.
</p>
<p>As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Arch uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sections of archlinux.org where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require your browser to accept cookies.
</p>
<p>Generally, we use cookies to:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to provide a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "sign in" and is modified when you "sign out" of our services.</li>
<li>Estimate audience size. Each browser accessing Arch is given a unique cookie that is used to determine the extent of repeat usage and usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user.</li>
<li>Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of Arch's network of websites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our infrastructure needs to scale to meet demand.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time if you accept them or not. However, you must understand that the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain services (see 1. above), and choosing to reject cookies will reduce the performance and functionality of the site. Your browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located in the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Our_commitment_to_data_security">Our commitment to data security</span></h3>
<p>Arch staff and administrators are familiar with our privacy policy guidelines. Our websites enforce Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, which encrypts your personal data when you send your personal information on our website.

Please remember that <i>any information</i> that is disclosed in these areas becomes <b>public information</b>. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal data. Although we value individual ideas and encourage free expression, Arch reserves the right to take necessary action to preserve the integrity of these areas, such as removing any posting that is vulgar or inappropriate. See our <a href="../en/Code_of_conduct.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Code of conduct">Code of conduct</a> for what is acceptable behaviour.
</p>
<p>It is in the interest of the Arch community to provide all users an accurate record of data and content provided in the public forums it maintains and uses; to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes; and to provide an environment for the free exchange of ideas relevant and constructive to the development and propagation of open source software.

<p>Where the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN">EU General Data Protection Regulation</a> 2016/679 (“GDPR”) applies to the processing of your personal data, especially when you access the website from a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have the following rights, subject to some limitations, against Arch:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to access your personal data;</li>
<li>The right to rectify the personal data we hold about you;</li>
<li>The right to erase your personal data;</li>
<li>The right to restrict our use of your personal data;</li>

</p>
<p>Where the GDPR applies, you also have the right to withdraw any consent you have given to uses of your personal data. If you wish to withdraw consent that you have previously provided to Arch, you may do so via email to the relevant administrators. However, the withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
